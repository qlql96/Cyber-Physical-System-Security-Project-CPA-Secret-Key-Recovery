# CZ4055 Cyber Physical System Security Group Project

Given a set of power traces (in a csv file format as captured in the lab), a Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) program is developed in this project to implement CPA on the given traces to extract the key. A python script is also written to visualize the output of the CPA by plotting two types of graphs.
